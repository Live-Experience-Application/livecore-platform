## Start here

Read in order:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `docs/00_START_HERE.md`
3. `docs/01_PRODUCT_VISION_AND_SCOPE.md`
4. `docs/02_ARCHITECTURE.md`
5. `docs/04_PRODUCT_BOUNDARIES.md`

Do not implement code until the first story is selected.

csv/                     backlog stories and forbidden term list
```

## Prerequisites

- .NET SDK 10.0 or later
- Node.js 22 or later
- pnpm 10 (pinned via the `packageManager` field; with Corepack run `corepack enable pnpm` once, or prefix pnpm commands with `corepack`)

## Build, test and boundary scan

Run all commands from the repository root.

Build the .NET solution:

```bash
dotnet build LiveCore.slnx
```

Run the smoke tests:

```bash
dotnet test LiveCore.slnx
```

Install and build the TypeScript packages:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm --recursive run build
```

Run the boundary scan (fails with a non-zero exit code if any forbidden
vertical term from `csv/forbidden_core_terms.csv` appears in Core source under
`apps/`, `packages/`, `tests/` or `scripts/`):

```powershell
# Windows (Windows PowerShell 5.1 or pwsh)
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/boundary-scan.ps1
```

```bash
# Linux/macOS (PowerShell 7+)
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/boundary-scan.ps1
```
