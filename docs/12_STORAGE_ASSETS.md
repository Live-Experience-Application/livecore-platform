# Storage and Assets

## Storage abstraction

Core uses an S3-compatible storage adapter.

Supported deployment options:

- RustFS for self-hosted S3-compatible object storage
- any S3-compatible provider in hosted environments

## Security rules

- buckets private by default
- no public object listing
- upload intent requires authorization
- download URL requires authorization
- signed URLs are short-lived
- asset metadata is filtered by visibility rules

## Asset lifecycle

```text
Create upload intent
  -> client uploads to storage
  -> client confirms upload
  -> Core stores asset metadata
  -> asset can be linked to ContentBlock or Entity
  -> visibility controls whether it can be accessed
```

## Metadata

Assets should track:

```text
asset_id
organization_id
workspace_id
storage_provider
bucket
object_key
content_type
size_bytes
checksum
created_by
created_at
status
```

## Avoid

- storing large binary files in PostgreSQL
- public bucket access
- long-lived signed URLs
- direct storage credentials in frontend
