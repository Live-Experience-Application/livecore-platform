## Authorization principles

- Role checks are not enough; object-level authorization is required.
- Organization boundary must be checked before workspace boundary.
- Workspace boundary must be checked before resource-level visibility.
- Participant visibility is computed server-side.
- Audit roles may view metadata but should not automatically view sensitive content unless explicitly allowed.
