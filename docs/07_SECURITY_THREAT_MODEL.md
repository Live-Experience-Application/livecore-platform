# Security Threat Model

## Primary security promise

A participant must never receive content they are not authorized to see.

This includes REST API responses, realtime events, asset metadata, asset downloads, search results, exports and offline cache payloads.

## Main threats

### T1: Broken object-level authorization

Risk:

- user guesses resource ID and reads another workspace resource

Controls:

- organization + workspace + resource authorization on every endpoint
- negative tests for foreign IDs
- no direct repository access from controllers

### T2: Visibility leak through API

Risk:

- API returns hidden content and UI hides it

Controls:

- server-side filtering
- participant DTOs exclude hidden fields
- tests compare Host response vs Participant response

### T3: Realtime event leak

Risk:

- WebSocket group receives event for wrong participant

Controls:

- recipient calculation in Visibility module
- per-recipient event projection
- reconnect replay filters events again

### T4: Asset leak

Risk:

- private asset is reachable via static URL

Controls:

- private buckets only
- signed URL after authorization
- no public object listing
- short-lived URLs

### T5: Tenant isolation failure

Risk:

- data from organization A is visible to organization B

Controls:

- organization_id on tenant-scoped tables
- composite indexes with organization_id/workspace_id
- authorization middleware and tests

### T6: Invite abuse

Risk:

- leaked invite token grants unwanted access

Controls:

- scoped invite tokens
- expiry
- revocation
- role limitation
- audit logs

### T7: Log leaks

Risk:

- private scene content appears in logs

Controls:

- structured logs with IDs, not sensitive body content
- redaction policies

### T8: Export leak

Risk:

- participant export includes hidden content

Controls:

- export role-based projection
- explicit host/admin export scopes

### T9: Abuse / denial of service

Risk:

- an unauthenticated client floods the anonymous store-notification webhooks (each call does database work and
  runs an external parser — a DoS and ledger-amplification surface), or probes invite-token / organizationSlug
  enumeration
- an authenticated client hammers the API with no per-caller ceiling

Controls:

- ASP.NET Core rate limiting (`UseRateLimiter`, CORE-SEC-001): a strict per-IP limit on the anonymous webhooks
  and a per-principal global limit on the authenticated surface; excess requests get `429`
- a hard request-body-size cap on the anonymous webhooks beyond the application-level payload cap
- all limits configurable; `429` Problem Details carry no tenant/principal/resource detail (T7)

## Required test categories

- foreign workspace ID denial
- hidden content denial
- reveal to selected participants only
- asset download denial
- realtime event recipient filter
- reconnect replay filter
- audit creation for visibility changes
